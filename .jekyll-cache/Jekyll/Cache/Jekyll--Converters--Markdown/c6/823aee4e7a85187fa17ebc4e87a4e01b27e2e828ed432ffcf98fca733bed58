<p>A bill signed into law yesterday gives all women in Oregon, documented and undocumented,insured and uninsured, access to reproductive care at little to no cost. Insurance companies are now required to cover everything from abortion, birth control, STI and pregnancy tests, sterilization procedures, postpartum care, and the many more related drugs and procedures.</p>

<p>The Reproductive Health Equity Act (HB 3391) was introduced earlier this year in response to the first attempts of the Trump administration to remove and replace the Affordable Care Act. On August 15, Governor Kate Brown signed the bill into law. Men will also benefit from the bill and can receive vasectomies with no out of pocket cost.</p>

<p>Tax money has been allocated to support those who need reproductive care, but don’t have or can’t afford insurance. Currently that fund is 10.2 million, which is enough to last through 2019.</p>

<p>This bill allows women extra protection if the ACA is replaced, or Roe v. Wade is overturned. The bill even addresses potential loopholes and costs so women can allocate the services they need.</p>
