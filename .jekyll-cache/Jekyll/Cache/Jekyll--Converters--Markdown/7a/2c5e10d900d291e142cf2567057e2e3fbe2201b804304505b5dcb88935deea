<p>In late August, white supremacist Richard Spencer was denied the ability to rent a room at the Kellogg Center to speak on Michigan Stateâ€™s campus. Last night, Kyle Bristow, an MSU graduate and attorney by career, filed a lawsuit against the university on behalf of Cameron Padgett, who has been arranging Spencerâ€™s speaking tour.</p>

<p>At the time of the request by Spencerâ€™s organization, university leaders had cited the recent violence at Charlottesville as the main point of concern for student safety. As of today, it is unclear whether that decision will be reversed.</p>

<p>The complaint cites that Spencerâ€™s application to speak at the university was denied because the university doesnâ€™t agree with the National Policy Institute (NPI) over legitimate safety concerns. Padgett is looking for a jury trial and punitive damages from the university.</p>

<p>We again spoke to MSU student body president Lorenzo Santavicca on the issue.</p>

<p>â€œWhile the beliefs of the group may counteract the values of our MSU student body and university community,â€ he said, â€œwe must be able to recognize the fundamental American rights in freedom of expression.â€</p>

<p>As of now, it is not clear whether or not NPI will be speaking on campus, but Santavicca assures that if they do, student safety will be a top priority.</p>

<p>â€œI trust that the university will provide the necessary resources and work with its partners in law enforcement to make this happen,â€ Santavicca said.</p>
