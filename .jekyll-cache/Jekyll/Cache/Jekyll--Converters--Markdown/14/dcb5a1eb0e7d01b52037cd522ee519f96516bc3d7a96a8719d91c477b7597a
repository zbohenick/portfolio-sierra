  <p>Simon called Trump’s executive order on immigration “deeply concerning”</p>

<p>President Trump’s announcement of an executive order on immigration Friday afternoon was met with immediate unrest and led to protests in airports around the nation. His order has banned anyone coming from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia from entering the United States. Trump claims his executive order is about the protection of U.S. citizens, not about religion.</p>

<p>The University of Michigan, Western Michigan University and now Michigan State University have all stood up for their immigrant students by refusing to release their immigration statuses. MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon has released a statement which condemns the views Trump has vocalized toward refugees and immigrants.</p>

<p>“President Trump’s executive order on immigration is deeply concerning,” Simon wrote. “It runs counter to the global nature of our communities and our nation…this order, and the manner it was implemented, is not the best approach.”</p>

<p>“The ban is inappropriate,” Nancy Sethi, an MBA student at MSU said. “No human is illegal; everybody should be allowed to come into the US.”</p>

<p>The Muslim Society had a variety of speakers, from a variety of nationalities, race, and religions speak about how they were being affected by the ban. An advocate of the Native American tribes in Michigan encouraged attendees, through a poem, to stand up for one another, because they’ll be the people who can help when it’s your time of need.</p>

<p>The president of the Muslim Student’s Association, Ibrahim Abdoulahi, brought to light the global issues that come along with this ban. He noted how the protesters were standing outside freezing, but at least they could go home and get warm; in Syria people were freezing to death. He spoke about how difficult and expensive getting visas already was. He also told the story of his uncle who recently died in a bombing in Yemen, all because he couldn’t get into the United States.</p>

<p>Overall, they spoke about unity. About how protesters “can’t just stand with signs” anymore, they have to follow through with a call to action. That call to action is calling and emailing officials, like Bill Schuette and others, who are supporting the ban.</p>

<p>The protest ended on a positive note when it was announced that Lansing is on its way to becoming a sanctuary city.</p>
